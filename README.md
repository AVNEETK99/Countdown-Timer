# Countdown-Timer

A countdown timer is a timer that counts down from a specified time to zero. It is often used to track the time left until a specific event or task needs to be completed. Countdown timers are commonly used in various contexts such as sports events, cooking, exams, presentations, meetings, and more. They can be implemented in a variety of ways, including digital clocks, mobile apps, and web applications.

## Instructions to run the game

* Open the Github repository where the game code is hosted.

* Click on the green "Code" button and then select "Download ZIP" to download the code as a ZIP file.

* Extract the ZIP file to a folder on your computer.

* Open a command prompt or terminal window and navigate to the folder where you extracted the code.

* Type ```python countdown.py``` and press Enter to start the game.

* Follow the prompts to play the game.

## Functionality of the code

* ```Import the time module```: The code imports the time module which allows for time-related functionality in Python.

* ```Define the countdown function```: The code defines a function called ```"countdown"``` that takes a single argument "t" which is the amount of time to count down in seconds.

* ```Enter the while loop```: The code enters a while loop that runs as long as "t" is not equal to zero.

* ```Calculate minutes and seconds```: In each iteration of the while loop, the code uses the ```"divmod"``` function to calculate the number of minutes and seconds remaining in "t".

* ```Format the timer```: The code formats the minutes and seconds into a string that represents the countdown timer using the ```"{:02d}:{:02d}"``` format specifier.

* ```Print the timer```: The code prints the timer string to the console using the ```"print"``` function.

* ```Sleep for 1 second```: The code pauses execution for 1 second using the ```"time.sleep"``` function.

* ```Decrement the countdown```: The code decrements "t" by 1 second.

* ```Print "Fire in the hole!!"```: When the while loop terminates (i.e. when "t" is equal to zero), the code prints "Fire in the hole!!" to the console.

* ```Input the time in seconds```: The code prompts the user to enter the time in seconds using the ```"input"``` function and stores the value in the variable "t".

* ```Call the countdown function```: The code calls the ```"countdown"``` function and passes in the integer value of "t" as the argument.
